# Take Your C# Skills to the Next Level - Labs Only   
**Full-day Workshop**  
*Level: Intermediate*  

## Description
This repository contains the only the labs for the full-day workshop "Take Your C# Skills to the Next Level". For details about the workshop, please refer to the main workshop page: [https://github.com/jeremybytes/vslive2024-orlando/tree/main/VSF02-CSharpWorkshop](https://github.com/jeremybytes/vslive2024-orlando/tree/main/VSF02-CSharpWorkshop)  

## Hands-on Lab Requirements:

* You must provide your own laptop computer for the hands-on lab portions of the day.

* Interactive labs can be completed using Windows, macOS, or Linux -- anywhere .NET 8 will run.

* You need to have the .NET 8 SDK installed as well as the code editor of your choice (Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition or Visual Studio Code are both good (free) choices).  

* You will also need the lab files with the code and instructions. These can be obtained from this repository.

### Links:

* .NET 8.0 SDK  
[https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

* Visual Studio 2022 (Community)  
[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)  
Note: Install the "ASP.NET and web development" workload for the labs and samples. Include ".NET desktop development" for "digit-display" sample and WPF-based samples.

## Hands-on Labs

The "Labs" folder contains the hands-on labs. As noted above, this workshop will not have dedicated lab time, but each lab has a step-by-step walkthrough if you want to try things out yourself.  

* [Lab 00 - Application Overview](Labs/Lab00/)  
* [Lab 01 - Adding Interfaces for Better Control](Labs/Lab01/)  
* [Lab 02 - Adding Unit Tests](Labs/Lab02/)  
* [Lab 03 - More Dependency Injection](Labs/Lab03/)  

Each lab consists of the following:  
* **Labxx-Instructions** (Markdown)  
A markdown file containing the lab instructions. This includes a set of goals and step-by-step instructions. This can be viewed on GitHub or in Visual Studio Code (just click the "Open Preview to the Side" button in the upper right corner).  

* **dotnet8** (Folder)  
Lab code is available for .NET 8.0.

    * **Starter** (Folder)  
    This folder contains the starting code for the lab.  
    * **Completed** (Folder)  
    This folder contains the completed solution. If at any time you get stuck during the lab, you can check this folder for a solution.  

In addition, each lab builds on the previous. So the "Completed" of Lab 01 is the "Starter" of Lab 02. If you go through the labs in order, you can keep using the same solution as you move from lab to lab.
